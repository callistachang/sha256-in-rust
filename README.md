# SHA256 in Rust

An implementation of SHA256 with Rust based on [this publication](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf).

[This visualization](https://sha256algorithm.com/) of SHA256 was pretty great for reference.

## Motivation

I just read the Rust book and wanted to try making a small thing with it!
